# Galvanize Q3 Project - "Frankie's Fruit Market" by Frankie DeNell

### Project Description
Frankie's Fruit market is a mock-market dedicated to providing the highest quality organic, tropical, exotic, and rare fruits to people all over the United States. It's a fruit hub created to make these fruits accessible to anyone, anywhere in the country. Frankie's Fruit Market sells delicious fruits such as mamey, jackfruit, black sapote, jaboticaba, sapodilla, durian, and all kinds of rare bananas.

### Who uses it?
Fruit lovers! And anyone who wants to experience the best tasting exotic and tropical fruits.

### What outputs do they need?
User outputs will be the products displayed in the cart when the user clicks the "Add to Cart" button on fruits they want to purchase. On the Admin end, outputs will be the actual fruits listed for sale that they post.

### What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
The user input is selecting the fruit/quantity they want to buy. Admin input will be the fruit name, images, price, and description. There will also be an admin login page, when the admin enters their email and password, they will be able to navigate to an "Add New Fruit" form to post more fruits for sale.

### Technologies I am using
For the backend I will be using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
For the front end I will be using React and Redux.
